Hello,

This is <b>Yimeng</b> from Beijing, China.

I'm currently a Computer Science graduate student at Cornell Tech.

After 4-years of study at the University of Maryland, I realized that Web Development is the thing that I’m most passionate about.

My wide range of interests in business, urban planning, and architecture stimulates me to keep exploring various possibilities.

In addition, I’m an enthusiastic fan of FOOTBALL (the real one) and a few Japanese bands.

Welcome to my blog site. It is built with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="https://www.jekyll.com/">Jekyll</a>. You are very welcome to share ideas and leave comments under any post.
